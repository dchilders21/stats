http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html

2. Download this repo

4. Go into 'src'> 'stats' and open  'goals.ipynb' and run the first box.  If everything is working correctly you should see 'INITIALIZED...'

5. The PDF report can be found in 'scr' > 'docs'.  'ML â€“ Capstone Project' is the report and 'Features_SP' is supporting data.
